# Cloud.gov post mortems

A post mortem is held as soon as possible after an incident. ITIL defines an incident as `Failure of a configuration item that has not yet affected service is also an incident â€” for example, failure of one disk from a mirror set. The ITIL incident management process ensures that normal service operation is restored as quickly as possible and the business impact is minimized.'

We keep our post mortems in [the wiki](https://github.com/18F/cloud-gov-postmortems/wiki) attached to this repo.

### How we run post mortems - the short version ###

Before the post mortem we will put together a timeline of the incident on the wiki, beginning at the time the incident was announced in Slack, and ending at the point the incident was declared ended. Everybody is welcome to add their observations to the timeline, including which actions were taken when, the effects observed, and their understanding of the events.

1. The facilitator starts by reading [the retrospective prime directive](http://www.retrospectives.com/pages/retroPrimeDirective.html)
2. We review the timeline and add anything we have missed
3. We analyze the factors that contributed to the incident
4. We propose, discuss and prioritize ways to incrementally improve our systems, and to test these improvements.

The work that comes out of the post mortem is then added to our backlog. We then schedule a meeting 2 months after the incident to review our progress.
