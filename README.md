# Cloud.gov post mortems

We keep our post mortems in [the wiki](https://github.com/18F/cloud-gov-postmortems/wiki) attached to this repo.

For more information on post mortems, check out:

### How we run post mortems - the short version ###

Before the post mortem we will put together a timeline of the incident on the wiki, beginning at the time the incident was announced in Slack, and ending at the point the incident was declared ended. Everybody is welcome to add their observations to the timeline, including which actions were taken when, the effects observed, and their understanding of the events.

1. The facilitator starts by reading [the retrospective prime directive](http://www.retrospectives.com/pages/retroPrimeDirective.html)
2. We review the timeline and add anything we have missed
3. We analyze the factors that contributed to the incident
4. We propose, discuss and prioritize ways to incrementally improve our systems, and to test these improvements.

The work that comes out of the post mortem is then added to our backlog. We then schedule a meeting 2 months after the incident to review our progress.
